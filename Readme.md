# Estimating lifetime value and customer equity for non-profit donors

Estimation of customer equity is an essential component for developing a successful Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy. Indeed, in many ways the CRM strategy should be designed to increase customer equity over time.  This is also true for nonprofit organizations, since much of their revenue is based on continued contribution of their active donors. 

This project attempts to improve the estimation of customer equity for a leading US nonprofit organization based on previous transaction and contact history.
